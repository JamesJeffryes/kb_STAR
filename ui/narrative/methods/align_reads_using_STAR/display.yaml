            Select the RNA-seq read set associated with the RNA-seq experiment. Alternatively, if you have only one sample of RNA-seq reads, select the corresponding object.

            Max number of multiple alignments allowed for a read
        short-hint : |
            Max number of multiple alignments allowed for a read, default to 20 (up/down+integer counter)          
    alignSJoverhangMin :
        ui-name : |
            Min overhang for unannotated junctions

    reads_condition :
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq reads condition
        short-hint : |
            Set the condition for the reads input. Ignored for sets of reads, required for singletons.
        long-hint : |
            Set the condition associated with the input reads object. This is required for a single sample, but ignored for sets of samples, since that is included in the set.

        ui-name : Alignment output filename extensions
        short-hint : When run on a set, individual alignments will be given names based on the reads object name appended with this extension        
    
description : |
    <p>The STAR app aligns the sequencing reads for a single or a set of two (paired end) reads to long reference sequences of a prokaryotic genome.</p> 
    <p>Basic STAR work flow consists of 2 steps:</p>
    <p>1. Generating genome indexes files: In this step user supplied the reference genome sequences (FASTA files) and annotations (GTF file), from which STAR generate genome indexes that are utilized in the 2nd (mapping) step. The genome indexes are saved to disk and need only be generated once for each genome/annotation combination.
    </p>
    <p>2. Mapping reads to the genome: In this step user supplies the genome files generated in the 1st step, as well as the RNA-seq reads (sequences) in the form of FASTA or FASTQ files. STAR maps the reads to the genome, and writes several output files, such as alignments (SAM/BAM), mapping summary statistics, splice junctions, unmapped reads, signal (wiggle) tracks etc. 
    </p>
