parameters :
    sampleset_ref :
        ui-name : |
            RNA-seq Sample or Sample Set
        short-hint : |
            Select the RNA-seq sample set or reads set. If you have only one sample of RNA-seq reads, select the corresponding library object.
    genome_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Genome
        short-hint : |
            Select the Genome to align the reads
    genomeFastaFile_refs :
        ui-name : |
            Reference Genome Fasta File(s)
        short-hint : |
            One or more FASTA files with the genome reference sequences            
        long-hint : |
            Specified one or more FASTA files with the genome reference sequences. Multiple reference sequences (henceforth called chromosomes) are allowed for each fasta file.
    readFilesIn_refs :
        ui-name : |
            Files containing the sequences to be mapped
        short-hint : |
            File name(s) (with path) containing the sequences to be mapped
        long-hint : |
            File name(s) (with path) containing the sequences to be mapped (e.g. RNA-seq FASTQ files).
    runMode :
        ui-name : |
            STAR Running Mode
        short-hint : |
            Set the running mode for STAR--'genomeGenerate' option directs STAR to run genome indices generation job
    runThreadN :
        ui-name : |
            Number of Threads to use
        short-hint : |
            Defines the number of threads to be used for genome generation, it has to be set to the number of available cores on the server node
    outFileNamePrefix :
        ui-name : |
            Prefix for Alignment Output File Names
        short-hint : |
            Prefix for all STAR output files
        long-hint : |
            STAR produces multiple output files. All files have standard name, however, you can change the file prefixes
    sjdbGTFfile_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Standard GTF Splice Junction file
        short-hint : |
            Path to the file with annotated transcripts in the standard GTF format
        long-hint : |
            STAR will extract splice junctions from this file and use them to greatly improve accuracy of the mapping
    sjdbOverhang :
        ui-name : |
            Splice Junction Overhang
        short-hint : |
            Length of the genomic sequence around the annotated junction
        long-hint : |
            Length of the genomic sequence around the annotated junction to be used in constructing the splice junctions database
            
description : |
    <p>The STAR app aligns the sequencing reads for a single or a set of two (paired end) reads to long reference sequences of a prokaryotic genome.</p> 
    <p>Basic STAR work flow consists of 2 steps:</p>
    <p>1. Generating genome indexes files: In this step user supplied the reference genome sequences (FASTA files) and annotations (GTF file), from which STAR generate genome indexes that are utilized in the 2nd (mapping) step. The genome indexes are saved to disk and need only be generated once for each genome/annotation combination.
    </p>
    <p>2. Mapping reads to the genome: In this step user supplies the genome files generated in the 1st step, as well as the RNA-seq reads (sequences) in the form of FASTA or FASTQ files. STAR maps the reads to the genome, and writes several output files, such as alignments (SAM/BAM), mapping summary statistics, splice junctions, unmapped reads, signal (wiggle) tracks etc. 
    </p>
